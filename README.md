This project was created to analyse email from the Decrypteur at Radio-Canada. The projet took place during the summer of 2020 as an internship with IVADO "des donn√©es pour raconter" in data journalism. The goal is to understand the theme of the question sent to the Decrypteur. Email are generaly formed as a question asking about the information in certain url or about a specific topic found on social media plateform such as Facebook.
